# UoM_Hackathon_April2025

In summary, we downloaded the year averages of stock data of our set of "trusted" stocks. We then indexed these to win the last two low-latency rounds. We started making another version of files to increase granularity to the month but this wasn't needed in the end.

**Check out main.py and algo.py. We read data from mean.txt and risk.txt which was precomputed with the scripts in the run_once folder**
